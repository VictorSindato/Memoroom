Using facebook's graph API to get my social graph:
- What information am I allowed to get about my friends?

Using object-oriented representation for the characters
- Understand how I'm getting information about the characters?
-

Representation:
- General function for making changes to the character's attribute representation eg. change from string to list
- bubblenet: Rewrite all the hard-coded information for smooth transition to another social circle


Idea generation:
- What are the things I'd want to do/learn/discover if I had a visualization of my entire facebook network?
  : Who I've interacted with the most and the [least?] (maybe use slider for this?)

- When a different ego is selected, resize every circle to radius size proportional to their relationship with ego and increase proximity
  : On centering ego, change the link-forces (specifically, strength) between that ego node and the rest of the nodes to be dependent on the closeness of their relationship.
  This is a search problem since the other link-forces between the other nodes stay the same.

Experimentation:
- Git branch
 : Zooming in on image on hover

- Write helper functions
